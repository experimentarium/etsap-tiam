# Regional Policies

Some countries set their own goals towards climate change. These policy goals include phase-out of conventional power plants, restrictions on nuclear technology installation, CO2-taxes and carbon neutrality.  Therefore, additional constraints are modelled in TIAM to include the policies of specific regions as well. 


## Nuclear Policy

All the countries have defined policies on maximum nuclear power plant installations for the future. In the case of Germany, nuclear phase-out plan is already put in action since 2023 [2] and hence, the current and future capacity of nuclear plants are zero. Accordingly, In TIAM, constraints are defined for maximum nuclear capacity for every region. 

Table 2: Maximum nuclear technology capacity (GW) constraint for every region until 2100 in TIAM model.

## Coal Policy

Based on the regional policies, minimum electricity consumption from coal power plants is also defined for every region. Therefore, for all regions, the region-specific policy restrictions on coal electricity consumption are entered as shown in Table 3.

## Climate neutrality goal

Some regions set their own goals for achieving climate neutrality. An example is explained for the TIAM region-Germany. The German Climate Action Plan for 2050 describes the CO2 reduction targets for 2030, 2040 and 2045 for all demand sectors along with a goal of achieving carbon neutrality in industry, transport and building sectors by 2045 [1]. These emission reduction targets are modelled in TIAM with the appropriate TIMES attributes and linearly interpolated between the years. Table 1 below shows the constraint placed on the emissions from different sectors for Germany. 

Table 1: CO2 emissions per sector in Germany modelled in TIAM.
| Sector      | Emissions (kt) |        |        |      |
|-------------|----------------|--------|--------|------|
|             | 2030           | 2040   | 2045   | 2100 |
| Industry    | 143231         | 102348 | 0      | 0    |
| Transport   | 98158          | 60780  | 0      | 0    |
| Building    | 72116          | 44655  | 0      | 0    |
| Upstream    | 183308         | 113504 | 4543.4 | 0    |
| Agriculture | 61099          | 50655  | 40089  | 0    |
