## CCS Potentials

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be referred to a process where the CO2 emissions coming from industrial processes is captured and transported to a long-term storage unit, generally underground. The aim is to mitigate green house gas emissions from industrial processes. In TIAM, many sources were used to gather the regional data on geological and ocean carbon storage potentials and their respective costs involved ( [1] , [2], [3]). There are significant uncertainities related to the data. A summary of the assumed CCS potentials per geographical area along with total potential is shown in the table below. The potentials have been calibrated based on the literature estimatated values ( [4], [5]).  From the table, it is evident that the deep saline aquifers have the highest potential, but high uncertainity as well. Hence, the costs in the TIAM model for deep saline aquifers were also considered very high so that it represents as a backstop option.
