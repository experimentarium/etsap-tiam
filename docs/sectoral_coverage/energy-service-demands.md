# Energy Service Demands 

TIAM comprises 42 energy-services in the five end-use sectors (see Table 1).

To fulfill each energy-service demand, a number of technologies exist. The technologies vary in terms of input fuel(s), efficiency and costs. 
In fact, each of the energy-services is treated as a function that con- sumes energy to satisfy the demand for a service (e.g., demand for auto transport, measured in billion vehicle kilometers). Similar to other bottom-up models, the energy-service demands in TIAM are projected exogenously. They are specified at the regional level based on a range of exogenously-given drivers such as GDP, GDP per capita, GDP per household and population. The energy-service demands are linked to the underlying drivers, using elasticity factors. The elasticity factors reflect the sensitivity of energy-service demands to a change in their underly- ing drivers. Usually, the assigned elasticities are less than one, highlighting that the energy- service demands grow slower than the underlying drivers.
As the energy-service demands in the TIAM model are projected exogenously, they are independent to their prices. This means that the projection of an energy-service demand is fixed unless either the driver or the elasticity parameter changes. Therefore, although TIAM shows how the energy-service demands can be satisfied at the lowest possible cost, it is not able to reflect the ‘price effect’ which refers to the impact of a change in energy prices on the demand of energy services (Parkin et al., 2005). Hence, although the model provides a detailed techno- logical representation of the energy system, it is not able to address the contribution of (price- dependent) energy-service demands in tackling climate change.
