# Time Resolution

The TIAM model covers a time horizon from 2015 to 2100, which is divided into ten periods. The model splits each time period into six time slices consisting of three seasons, namely, summer, winter, and intermediate with equal length (i.e., four months). To consider changes in load based on sector demand profiles, each season is further divided into day and night accounting for 16 hours and 8 hours, respectively (Figure 1).

Depending on the purpose of the study, the model is flexible to increase the number of inter-annual time-slices. This allows a much more detailed representation of variations in en- ergy demand and supply, including operating characteristics of specific technologies.
