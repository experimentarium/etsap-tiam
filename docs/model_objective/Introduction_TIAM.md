# Model Information

Energy system models are used to measure the impact of climate policy and find path dependencies when decarbonizing the energy system.
In this study, the global energy system TIAM [1, 2] is used. TIAM is a technology-rich bottom-up optimization model minimizing the total discounted system costs. On a spatial level, TIAM considers 16 regions, in which some regions are their own countries (e.g., the US) and others are aggregated (e.g., Africa); see Figure 1. Table 1 provides further information about the TIAM regions.

As a starting point of the underlying methodology, commodities are provided by domestic mining or imports as primary energy for further processing. Certain parameters are exogenously set as energy prices or potentials for mining. The primary energy is provided to be converted to the final energy sectors to satisfy the end use demand.
The end use sectors in TIAM are split into five different sectors (industry, transport, households, commercial and agriculture) (see Figure 2). TIAM distinguishes between processes and commodities. Processes are meant as all technologies that produce or provide commodities, e.g., cars in the transport sector or heating technologies in the household sector. All technologies have certain properties, such as their lifetime, investment costs, operation and maintenance costs and availability. The whole procedure is based on investment decisions. These properties ensure that there is a competition of all the technologies and a cost-optimal path can be found. Commodities are defined as all energy carriers (e.g., coal, oil, hydrogen, etc.) or materials (e.g., steel, cement, etc.) and can be produced out of technology processes, as well as emissions.
The time horizon TIAM considers starts in 2015 and ends in 2100. The demand is based on the statistics of the base year in 2015, and it is projected via drivers such as GDP or changes in population. Furthermore, TIAM distinguishes between twelve time slices. There are four for each season and three for day, night and the peak hour.
