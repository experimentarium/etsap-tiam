# Extraction and Mining of Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuels have limited resources. The total cumulative value of resources for each TIAM region have been found out from various literature sources for all the conventional commodities, i.e. coal, oil and gas, and calibrated to the TIAM’s base year 2018. The commodities have been further categorized based on type, extraction process and political aspects. For instance, coal is categorized into hard coal and brown coal. Natural gas is categorized into conventional and unconventional gas resources. Conventional gas includes recoverable reserves, enhanced gas recovery and resources (contingent and undiscovered). Similarly, unconventional gas includes coal-bed methane, tight gas, aquifer gas and gas hydrates based on the extraction processes. Oil is as well categorized into conventional and unconventional oil resources. Unconventional oil reserves include oil sands, extra heavy oil and oil shale [1]. Furthermore, they are categorized into OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and NOPEC (Non-OPEC) resources [2]. OPEC include the oil resources in the 13 countries: Algeria, Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Venezuela. All other countries come under NOPEC category. In TIAM, all these processes have been modelled based on the categories mentioned above for the three commodities with different costs and cumulative resources. 

## Reserves and costs

In order to make sure that resources are not exhausted within few years after extraction, constraints are set on the usage of the commodity every year. For all the resources, an upper limit for the use of the resource is defined for each period. In TIAM, 10 % of the cumulative resource is set as constraint/available reserve for each year until 2100. Based on the reserve constraint and cumulative resource, TIAM model automatically calculates commodity usage for the global processes every year. Costs for the resource extraction are found out for the base year 2018 and the same or similar costs are extrapolated until 2100. An example for hard coal resource, reserves and the costs for each TIAM region is shown in Table 1. 

Table 1: Cumulative resource, reserve available annually and the associated costs per TIAM region for hard coal from 2015 until 2100.
